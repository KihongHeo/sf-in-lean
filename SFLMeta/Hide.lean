/-!
`Block.hide` wraps regions marked `-- HIDE ... -- /HIDE` in the code-forward
source.  Its Verso processing is *identical* to `:::dev` / `:::instructor`: the
directive body is dropped at elaboration (via the shared `noopDirectiveFor`
expander), so it renders nothing and never reaches the generated outputs, while
the original text survives verbatim in the generated `…Verso.lean` source.  It
is emitted as a container directive (`::::hide`) because it wraps a region of
content rather than a single comment.  The block is kept under its own name so a
later build can treat hidden regions differently. -/
